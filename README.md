# Setting-Out Alignment
Tunnel Alignment is the center line of tunnel construction project. Tunnel survey need to crosscheck the alignment before using for survey work.
So I created the coding to compute the setting-out of horizontal and vertical alinment for reducing my mistake and time. The coding was created 2 languages which're python and vba excel.
